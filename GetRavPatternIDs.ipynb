Also, when I try to do an AND search with different ratings values there are no search results found. This makes sense, as a patter should only have one rating value. One downside is that a pattern's rating might change over time, so it's possible that the ratings could change slightly while I scrape. I haven't seen duplicate pattern IDs in any of the other groups so far, but it's possible I could see duplicates here. Regardless, I don't anticipate this being a large source of inaccuracy--just small fluctuations.\n",
